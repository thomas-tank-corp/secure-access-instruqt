ðŸ‘‹ Getting started
===============

The first task is to deploy HCP Boundary and Vault clusters with Terraform.

Export your HCP credentials so Terraform can authenticate agaist the HashiCorp Cloud Platform:

```
export HCP_CLIENT_ID="..."
```

```
export HCP_CLIENT_SECRET="..."
```

In the Workstation terminal, move into the `hcp-deploy` directory `cd hcp-deploy` and execute
`terraform init` and then `terraform apply`. Type yes when prompted.

The deployment will take around 10 minutes. When you see Terraform return `Apply Complete!` in the terminal, hit the green next button in the bottom right hand corner.
