ðŸ‘‹ Getting started
===============

The first task is to deploy HCP Boundary and Vault clusters with Terraform.

Click into the HCP tab using your HCP credentials. If you don't have an account, please sign-up. No credit card details are required and you will be creditted with $50 to start.

Select the project you created, as shown in the screenshot below

![HCP Project Screenshot](../assets/hcp-project.png)

When you're in your project, click on Access control (IAM) on the left-hand side and then into Service principals and create a new Service principal

![HCP Service Principal](../assets/hcp-service-principals.png)

Add a Service prinipal name, leave the Select service as Project and put the Select role to Admin and click Create service principal. When you have done this you will see the ability to click Keys on the left hand side.

Click on + Generate key and you will be shown a Client ID and Client secret. Please note that when you close this box you will not be able to view these details again, so either make a note of them or keep this screen open whilst we deploy Boundary and Vault.

For more information around creating a service principle, please visit this website: https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/iam/service-principals#create-a-service-principal

Export your HCP credentials so Terraform can authenticate agaist the HashiCorp Cloud Platform:

```
export HCP_CLIENT_ID="..."
```

```
export HCP_CLIENT_SECRET="..."
```

In the Workstation terminal, move into the `hcp-deploy` directory

```
cd hcp-deploy
```

Now execute the following commands

```
terraform init
terraform apply
 ```

Type yes when prompted.

The deployment will take around 10 minutes. When you see Terraform return `Apply Complete!` in the terminal, hit the green next button in the bottom right hand corner.

Whilst you're waiting - later on in the track we will connect to some targets. We will connect via differing methods, so whilst the clusters are provisioning, please could you download (if you don't have them already) and install the following:

* Boundary Desktop Client - https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/tutorials/oss-getting-started/oss-getting-started-desktop-app
* RDP client (if using a Mac) - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12
